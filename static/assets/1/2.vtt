00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.560
That’s a value judgement I’m not averse to it

2
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.520
I think that in some ways we are superior to other races 

3
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.720
because we seem to be the most creative, we seem to be the most compassionate,

4
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.040
I don’t think we’re the most intelligent,

5
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.200
that’s not the case.

6
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.920
Ashkenazi Jews and East Asians are *inaudible* we know that.

7
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.920
But yeah in some ways, yeah I think we are superior.

8
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.880
But that does not mean mean—and this is a crucial thing that I have said on my channel many times—

9
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.880
that does not mean that I hate anyone.
